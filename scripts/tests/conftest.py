"""Pytest configuration that travels with the kit's tests.

WHY A CONFTEST AND NOT A ROOT INI FILE (issues #33, #112). The `driftcheck`
marker below has to be registered wherever these tests are *collected*, and the
kit's tests are vendored into adopter repos under `paths.engines` — an adopter
running `pytest scripts/devkit/tests` collects them against THEIR rootdir and
THEIR ini file. Registration in this repo's root would therefore work here and
silently do nothing for every adopter, which is the failure mode the kit exists
to avoid. A conftest beside the tests moves with them.

`pyproject.toml` is doubly excluded: besides not travelling, a root
`pyproject.toml` makes `uv run --with pytest … python` fall into project mode
and materialise a `.venv/` and a stub `uv.lock` — see the header of `ruff.toml`,
where that was measured.

    Unregistered marks still *match* under `-m`, so the exclusion would work
    without this — it would just warn (`PytestUnknownMarkWarning`) on every run.
    A warning attached to the one command a reviewer is told to trust is exactly
    the kind of noise that gets the command dropped, so the mark is declared.
