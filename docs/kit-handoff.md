Last updated: 2026-07-30 — `#75`/`#163` Sink 1/`#136` and `#124` both shipped; eight review
rounds measured the same thing about themselves, and the review bot woke up.

## Latest session — 2026-07-30 (two merges, eight rounds, and where every defect lived)

**Theme —** Both PRs landed. The durable result is a measurement neither PR set out to make:
**across eight panel rounds and sixteen completed lens runs, every HIGH finding was in prose
written to explain the change — never in the change.** Both deliverables went uncontested by every lens
and by the bot; the explanations around them failed repeatedly.

- **`#166` merged (`eeef647`).** `fallback-review-panel.md` contract item 7: `#75`'s inversion
  (*assume* the worktree points at the wrong ref, not *verify* it), `#163` Sink 1's recovery
  (diff the **named sha** — verified working from a wrong-ref worktree by four lenses, including
  against a `chmod -R a-w` source), and `#136`'s scratch-path isolation. `#75`'s second half had
  no home in the contract, so it is **item 10**, appended rather than renumbered.
- **`#168` merged (`046e9ce`).** `#124`'s documented default flipped to `false` — and the key
  turned out to be in **no config file and read by no code**. The larger find:
  `post-merge-systemize.md` **hardcoded `gh pr create --draft`**, so the key it documents in its
  own table had no effect on the one place that workflow opens a PR (Principle #10).
- **Filed:** `#167` (item 7 now carries four requirements under one number; stable numbering
  blocks splitting it), `#169` (`/adopt`+`/upgrade` drafts, plus the shipped CLAUDE.md template's
  draft-first baseline with no scheduled-run carve-out), `#170` (draft-bit verification, with all
  three failed attempts recorded). Occurrence comments on `#44`, `#45`, `#116`, `#140`.

**Learned**

- **A lens cannot know whether a tree is its own.** `git switch --detach` was documented as the
  cheapest route to a writable tree; every lens run was placed in the **live checkout** instead,
  so literal compliance would have detached a real branch — invisibly, since detaching at the same
  sha changes no byte. The guard added next **failed open from any subdirectory** (`--git-dir`
  absolute, `--git-common-dir` relative-to-cwd) and asked the wrong question anyway, because
  `dev_session.sh` builds lanes as worktrees. No git command answers *is this tree mine*. The rule
  that survived needs no discrimination: never write inside a tree you did not create.
- **A command menu in doctrine is a defect generator.** Every menu item 7 carried had a measured
  defect — routes documented as "blocked outright" that all three worked, `--is-shallow-repository`
  returning false for a partial clone, `merge-base --is-ancestor` passing on a stale base,
  `ls-remote origin origin/main` returning empty. What a given invocation does depends on how the
  runtime built the tree, so the bullets now state what must be **true** and make each lens
  establish its own route.
- **Deleting beat correcting, now four-for-four.** The two rounds across both PRs that *shrank*
  the text are the two that produced no follow-on HIGH. Every round that added an explanation
  produced the next round's finding — including three attempts at one comparative claim, each
  narrowing the quantifier while keeping the class, and a "de-duplicate" commit that took the
  duplicate count from two to three.
- **A check heading is a claim, and a metric can be blind by construction.** The rendering check
  counted `<pre>` elements — but a correctly rendered fence *adds* one, so `0` reads identically
  for "no fence" and "mangled fence". A true measurement supporting a false conclusion, under a
  "Verified" heading. Withdrawn rather than repaired (`#116`).
- **The review bot was throttled, not absent.** CodeRabbit reviewed after 13+ silent PRs, then
  rate-limited, then returned clean — all on one PR. That settles `#45` for this repo, and the
  clean pass reproduced `#44` exactly: it created **no review object**, so `coverage` reported the
  bot three heads behind while its commit status said `Review completed` on head.

**Open, and owned by nothing yet**

- **`#124` stays open** — what shipped is prose only. For `triage-friction-log` nothing an adopter
  runs changed, because `#6`'s engine is unvendored and still hardcodes a draft.
- **`046e9ce` carries its `(#168)` suffix; `eeef647` does not.** Passing `--subject` to
  `gh pr merge` suppresses GitHub's auto-append, breaking commit→PR traceability for that one
  commit. Not repairable without rewriting protected `main`.
- The inbox is **206/150** and well over budget — this session added four entries to a file that
  was already over. `#167`, `#169`, `#170` are this session's three tickets.

▶ Next: **`session-start`** — three fresh tickets, an over-budget inbox, and no single obvious
thread. `#170` is the sharpest of the three (it blocks nothing but has a complete spec and three
recorded failures), `#164` remains unfixed and the wrap-up sweep touches that code every session,
and the cs-toolkit Phase 2 blockers (`#41`/`#37`/`#134`) are untouched.

______________________________________________________________________

## Earlier session — 2026-07-30 (one flag, six rounds, and a bug older than the PR)

**Theme —** `#74` shipped. The durable results are two: the review found a **pre-existing
data-loss bug in the tool that owns this file**, and it measured where six rounds of its own
effort actually went.

- **`#160` merged (`85cdeb0`).** `archive_plan_sessions.py --target-lines N` sweeps oldest-first
  until the handoff is at or under a *line* budget, so the remedy `check_doc_budget` names can
  actually discharge it — `--keep` counts blocks and was a no-op at its default. `budget_line_count`
  makes both tools measure a line the same way; `check_doc_budget` substitutes `{budget}` so the
  number lives in one place. **28 new test functions / 31 cases** (`--collect-only`: 56 → 87).
  Verified in production at this wrap-up: 419 → 355 lines.
- **`#164` filed — the find of the session, and it is NOT fixed.** `Path.write_text` truncates
  before writing, so a failed write destroys the document and the handler still prints *"no changes
  applied"*. Measured on a real full filesystem: a **26,807-byte handoff went to 0 bytes** while the
  tool reported nothing had happened. Latent in the archive engine all along.
- **`atomic_write` was attempted for it and REVERTED** — four HIGH regressions, found independently
  by both lenses: `os.replace` replaces a symlinked doc rather than writing through it, file
  mode/ownership reset every sweep, a fixed temp name lets concurrent runs publish each other's
  bytes, and a pre-existing temp symlink becomes an arbitrary-file clobber. All silent, all at
  exit 0.
- **The mitigation that shipped instead was itself defective three times, which is the session's own
  thesis biting the session.** `02c70ac` — `--help` still promised a rollback the first write never
  gets, a sentence true only while `atomic_write` existed and left standing through the revert.
  `15c8651` — the check named `<handoff>`, but under ENOSPC the *history* fails and the handoff
  rolls back clean, so the instruction **green-lit the damage it was written to catch** (measured:
  an archive committed at 12 of 39 sessions). `37aebd9` — the recovery said
  `git checkout -- <handoff>`, which discards this session's own block.
- **Also filed:** `#161` (LOW imprecisions; **two mutants still survive** — the megaline trim and
  `--target-lines < 1`), `#162` (the sweep is not byte-preserving), `#163` (where the review cycles
  went).

**Learned**

- **A fix stops at the first site**, and it is not a prose problem. The sharpest was
  `(OSError, UnicodeDecodeError)` applied to one of two exception classes *on the same line*,
  leaving exit 1 producible against a contract admitting only 0/2/3 — with the correct fix already
  sitting in `check_memory_budget.py:192-197` under a comment giving the reason. `#163` enumerates
  five occurrences; the PR's 13 commits carry more, **twice inside a fix for this very pattern**.
  Counts on `#163` predate rounds 5–6 and were not refreshed — treat the issue as the record and
  this line as a pointer.
- **A fix round that adds a new mechanism is where the next HIGH comes from.** Three times across
  seven review passes: round 2's `.format()` template → round 3's crash; round 5's `atomic_write` →
  round 6's four HIGHs → reverted; round 6's mitigation paragraph → the confirmation pass. The
  doctrine already says a new mechanism gets filed however squarely a finding prompted it; this is
  the measured version of why.
- **A hypothesis was stated as falsifiable and refuted within one round.** Apparent lens
  specialisation (adversarial finds mechanism, correctness finds prose) was coincidence — round 5's
  correctness lens led with a mechanism defect. On `#163` rather than dropped, because doctrine
  built on it would have rested on nothing.
- **Execution found the bugs that mattered; reading found more of them.** The filled ramdisk,
  `RLIMIT_FSIZE` and a planted symlink produced `#164` and the `atomic_write` HIGHs — nothing else
  would have. But the one-of-two-sites class, which is most of the session's fixes, was found by
  reading. The fuzz harnesses lived in session scratch and are gone: those runs are attestations,
  not reproducible evidence.

**Open, and owned by nothing yet**

- **This handoff block was itself panel-reviewed, and both lenses found it flattering.** It
  originally described the fallback mitigation in one sentence while three commits fixed defects in
  it, carried a stale test count, and asserted `#163` figures that contradicted `#163`. Corrected
  here. **The merged tree of `#160` was never seen by a lens** — the final panel reviewed `84dc129`,
  three doc/test commits followed, and the PR's review record says so explicitly (`#27`).
- **`#42` reproduced at merge time** on `#160`: posting the review record un-converged it
  (`review_evidence.valid: true`, blockers empty, `mergeable: false`) and needed `--mark-seen`.
  Occurrence data on the issue, not the inbox.
- **`#73` gained a new instance from this session's sweep** — the moved block says *"see the latest
  session's open list"* about `#132`, which resolves to nothing inside the history file. Not
  repaired here; recorded so the count is honest.
- The inbox is **168/150** and unchanged: today's friction went to the tracker (`#161`–`#164`),
  the routing Principle #2 prescribes. The guard-chaining rule (`check && act`) is the one entry
  that lives only there.

▶ Next: **`#163` Sink 1 + `#75`** — every lens run this session (18 of 18) sat on the base commit
with an empty `origin/main...HEAD` diff and re-derived a workaround. But the cheap fix is not the
`git archive` recipe: worktrees share the object store, so `git diff origin/main...<sha>` and
`git show <sha>:<path>` work directly, and the archive recipe was *refused by the sandbox* for one
lens. So: teach the launch prompt to diff against the **named sha** rather than `HEAD` (`#163`
Sink 1), and invert contract item 7 as `#75` actually asks. Then `#124`.

**Then the cs-toolkit thread, and note the vocabulary:** Phase 2's blockers remain
`#41`/`#37`/`#134` as the live blocks below state — all three still open, nothing discharged them.
What this session added is the argument that `#47` is their common cause, and that a prerequisite
slice (`#112`, `#33`, `#133`, `#135`, `#107` — the mutation/drift gate) should land first so the
verification everything after it relies on is trustworthy. That slice is a proposal, not an
established gate; `#164` also remains unfixed and the wrap-up sweep touches that code every session.

______________________________________________________________________

## Earlier session — 2026-07-29 (the sixth sweep, and three rounds that all found the same thing)

**Theme —** Three PRs merged. The result worth keeping is narrower than it first looked: across
three review rounds on one change, **justification prose was wrong in every round** — a recurring
defect category the mechanism's own tests cannot catch. Mechanism defects were found in every round
too; the first draft of this block claimed otherwise and a lens refuted it from the commits.

- **`#156` merged (`3d503c2`).** Sixth `triage-friction-log` sweep. Five inbox entries in, five
  accounted for: `#155` filed (a remark attributed to the operator must be quoted at its original
  scope) plus seven occurrence comments. Friction log 179 → 133 lines.
- **`#157` merged (`e9773ba`).** `#121`'s two halves. A gitignored `config/dev-model.local.yaml`
  merged over the tracked config for **`notify.user_key` only**; `tracker.*` stamped in the tracked
  file with a guard so no adopter inherits it — a non-interactive `init.sh` refuses a
  `project_name` that does not match the checkout's origin remote. Three adopter-facing defects
  fixed on the way: `/adopt` never seeded the ignore rule and never runs `init.sh`; the rule
  covered one filename while the loader derives `<name>.local.<ext>` for any path; and
  `add_ignore_line` turned a `.gitignore` ending `.env` into `.envstate/` across six call sites.
- **`#158` merged (`e76dd2c`).** `fallback-review-panel.md` now names the three failed
  stopping-rule designs, in addition to pointing at the fuller accounts, and separates a question they do not answer:
  **lens count is not bounded by class**, and the only sanctioned single-lens pass is Degraded
  mode, conditioned on runtime capability rather than on what the change contains.

**Learned**

- **Justification prose was wrong in all three rounds.** `_deep_merge`'s docstring said "two
  shapes" while implementing six; the overlay allowlist said its keys are "read by no shell reader"
  while `init.sh` read exactly them; a list rule was motivated by a key the same file asserts can
  never be set. It is written from *intent*, and intent is the one thing a reviewer cannot check
  against the code — nor can a test, which is why it recurred while the mechanism's defects were
  each fixed once. Correcting it added surface the next round then found defects in; **deleting it
  ended the loop**. That is the claim, and it is narrower than "the mechanism was never wrong",
  which a lens refuted: every round also found real mechanism defects, including three
  adopter-facing ones this block lists above.
- **One of the two late bugs was a regression from the previous round's fix, not both.**
  `pr_watch` re-raising at module import came from round 2's change and killed `--help`. The
  valueless-key-wipes-a-list hazard did not: round 1's guard was map-only from the start, so that
  route predates round 1 and survived it. The first draft claimed both, on four surfaces.
- **Generality was the defect, not the merge logic.** A config overlay honoured by one of several
  readers diverges everywhere. Narrowing to one key closed five findings at once — and `tracker.*`
  had to be removed after it made `session-start` on this repo query a project named
  "My Project Dev".
- **A single lens is a real pass.** One correctness lens on an 18-line docs change found six
  substantive issues, including a gloss that was roughly the inverse of what it described.
  Recorded as `fallback:claude`, not `fallback:panel`; the engine's own warning that one lens is
  not a green light is on the receipt.

▶ Next: `session-start` — several threads are open (`#121` still wants the friction-log header read
from config; `#124` and the `finalize.pr_draft` default now contradict the stated preference that
PRs not sit as drafts) and none is obviously first.

______________________________________________________________________

## Earlier session — 2026-07-29 (three failed designs, and what shipped instead)

**Theme —** An attempt to stop the previous sessions' review spirals. It failed three times, and
the failures are the result worth keeping.

- **`#153` merged (`b46f794`).** `fallback-review-panel.md` gains one section of *authoring*
  guidance — keep the record short, put detail in the PR, shorten a record that has needed
  repairing twice, and treat adopter-executed prose, commit messages and any record standing in
  for a control as first class. It loosens no control and says so explicitly. It also gave
  `workflows/pr-watch.md` the panel's missing precondition — that criterion applies only when the
  review bot is unavailable — and separated the poll/fix loop bound from per-change review rounds.
- **Three designs died first**, each killed by a panel on a real hole: a class defined by file
  type inside a section organised by function; the same class with functional tests, which the
  handoff passed while being the file the next session is told to act on; and a class-independent
  stop signal that beat the first class and whose trigger the author sets by choosing how verbose
  the fix round is.
- **Global git identity corrected** — `user.email` was `topi.jarvinen@gmail..com` (double dot) and
  `user.name` lacked its umlaut. Five commits from 2026-07-05/15 carry it; nothing from these
  sessions does, because GitHub's squash attribution used the account identity. Not rewritten.

**Learned**

- **Any rule whose trigger the author sets is a control the author can opt out of.** All three
  designs were versions of that, and the third one self-immunised: the commit proposing it
  rewrote the section, which by its own test made every later finding "prose the last fix wrote".
- **The premise was wrong.** "The record rounds did not earn their keep" does not survive: they
  caught a falsely closed issue, a false claim published to two tracker surfaces, and a falsified
  operator-approval record. The waste came from records being *elaborate*, not from being
  reviewed — and deleting prose (141 → 93 lines) is the only intervention that provably worked.

**Open, and owned by nothing yet**

- **The inbox is 179/150** and a sweep is due — the **fourth** consecutive session ending over
  budget (196, 203, 179, 179 since `06490a1`, against a budget of 150 throughout).
- **`#120` now carries this session's findings** — it proposes the cheaper terminal check these
  three designs were attempts at, so the reasons they broke are recorded there rather than only
  in this block.
- `#149`, `#150`, `#145`, `#146`, `#138`, `#139`, `#140`, `#141`, `#142`, `#143` and the rest per
  `session-start`.

▶ Next: `triage-friction-log` — the inbox has been over budget for four sessions. **Caveat before
running it unattended:** `notify.user_key` is blank, so the workflow stops at Step 2 by design; the
in-session-operator path is open regression `#128`, and `#124` records that its default draft PR
goes to a reviewer that will never read it.

No friction entries were added this session on purpose, and only one of the two lessons is in
doctrine: the record-length one is in `fallback-review-panel.md`, while *"any rule whose trigger
the author sets is a control the author can opt out of"* is recorded on `#120` — the tracker, not
the inbox, because it is the constraint any future attempt at that ticket must satisfy.

______________________________________________________________________

## Earlier session — 2026-07-29 (the fifth sweep, and a claim that was wrong in both directions)

**Theme —** One merge, four panel rounds, seven isolated lenses (two rounds on `#151`, two on the
wrap-up PR that records it). The sweep itself was never contested by any lens. The durable result is a failure mode the previous session's measurement
predicted but did not name: **an operator's narrow remark, inflated into a stronger claim and
published as operator-confirmed.** The fix for it then over-corrected, and round 2 caught that.

- **`#151` merged (`494b9eb`).** Fifth `triage-friction-log` sweep overall, dated 2026-07-29.
  Seven entries in, seven out: one graduated into two issues (`#149`, `#150`), six routed as
  seven occurrence comments (`#120`, `#138`, `#127`, `#75`, `#71`, `#45`, `#113`). LLM-only mode
  again (`#6` still not vendored). Inbox 203 → 136 against a 150 budget.
- **Two tickets filed:** `#149` (when a claim is corrected, enumerate every surface it was
  published to *at that moment*), `#150` (a scripted text replacement that matches nothing must
  fail, not report success).
- **The HIGH, and the HIGH inside its fix.** The operator said CodeRabbit is *currently* not
  available here. That was published as *"not installed, never exercised, nothing rate-limited"* —
  and then used to file a **structurally-never-reviews** verdict onto `#45`, the issue whose
  entire subject is that such a verdict cannot be made from outside. Both lenses found it
  independently. `#45`'s own body records a **Pro Plus** plan; `Review limit reached` notices sit
  on `#89` and `#99`. The correction then asserted a review count that was really a count of bot
  comments, and round 2 found *that*. Two independent re-derivations of "how many PRs did it
  actually review" disagreed with each other, so **no count was published**.
- **The silent run is twelve PRs, not seven** — `#102`, `#103`, `#104`, `#111` and `#148` were
  never counted. Third consecutive undercount in that series (four → six → seven → twelve). And
  `#151` merged silent too, so it is **thirteen** by the same rule — a lens caught the tally going
  stale inside the sentence announcing it was stale.

**Learned**

- **An operator's remark has a scope, and widening it is the same defect as inventing it.**
  "Currently not available" is not "never installed". The wider version was published on five
  surfaces and read as operator-confirmed on all of them, which is what made it durable.
  `#140` already asks for the command behind *"X is not available here"*; it arguably needs
  widening to cover *"X **is** available here, this much"* — round 2's finding.
- **Correcting a wrong number with a right one is a trap when the number is not recoverable.**
  Reviewed vs. quota-refused vs. silent is not cleanly separable from the comment stream without
  deciding what counts, and each attempt decided differently. Withdrawing the count was the only
  stable move — and the irreducibility is *better* evidence for `#45` than any count.
- **Deleting beat correcting, again — and it is now two-for-two.** Five review rounds across two
  sweeps have gone to the marker's verification section, every one finding the prose claiming more
  than the checks did. This session cut it rather than correct it a third time.
- **A check that errors can report a pass.** A closing-keyword scan built on a `grep -E`
  alternation with an empty branch was rejected by `ugrep`, exited non-zero, and the `|| echo
  clean` branch fired — printing a clean result from a check that never ran, inside the step
  guarding `#71`. A second run scanned a zero-byte surface and also read clean.
- **`#75`: 4 of 4 lens launches again**, all self-corrected. No running total is claimed; the
  addendum posted this session declares the existing tallies approximate and unreconcilable.
- **The check harness was left unfixed on purpose.** Round 2 showed checks 4/5 have headings
  larger than their assertions and that checks 1+2 share no trust chain (a forged snapshot yields
  byte-identical output). Documented, not repaired — building a harness inside a fix round is the
  mechanism-creep the panel doctrine warns against, and `#138`/`#127` exist to ask for it.

**Open, and owned by nothing yet**

- **`#149` and `#150`** — this session's two. `#149`'s own six-surface list **omits PR comments**,
  found by a lens after a retracted claim survived on one; that gap is unrecorded on the issue.
- **`#121` should absorb the config-placeholder question** rather than have it re-filed. This
  session re-derived `#121` from scratch without noticing it, and the rewrite of that entry then
  made a *larger* false claim than the one it corrected. The live inbox entry now routes there.
- **`#138` and `#127` are still the pair that would make a sweep's claims mechanically checkable**,
  and both were reproduced *again* inside this session's pilot run of them.
- **`#73` gained a *new* instance from this session's own archive sweep**, in the other direction:
  `kit-handoff-history.md` now says *"the 287-line figure **above**"* while that figure stayed in the
  live handoff. A lens found it; an earlier draft of this bullet claimed the *predicted* instance
  instead, which was the previous session's. Recorded in no routing row.
- **`#33`, `#112`, `#132` housekeeping is unchanged** from the previous session; `#132` is closed,
  so cs-toolkit Phase 2 blockers remain `#41`/`#37`/`#134`.
- **The inbox is back over budget the same day it was swept** — 179/150. The sweep took it 203 →
  136; wrapping up added four more entries and took it to 179. Not swept inline, per the
  wrap-up contract: graduating needs tracker writes and operator approval. Worth noting that a
  sweep now buys roughly one session of headroom, which is an argument for `#6` (vendor the
  engine) becoming urgent rather than merely open.

▶ Next: `session-start` — the threads are genuinely diffuse (two fresh tickets, two observations
recorded nowhere but here, and unchanged housekeeping), and nothing in the inbox is urgent despite it
being over budget. Page the tracker at `perPage: 25` reading `number`/`title`/`labels`/`state`
only — `#143` records `session-start` overflowing its tool limit at 68 open issues, and there are
~82 now.
