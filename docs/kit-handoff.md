# agentic-dev-kit — Living Plan (Handoff)

Last updated: 2026-08-04 — **The kit could not hold its own entry points, and shipped one of
them to every adopter.** `#288` fixed both halves. The durable result is the operator's
standing goal that reframed the ranking — Codex as an equal-enough development environment —
and a review record where the code converged early and the prose never did.

## Latest session — 2026-08-04 (the kit's own entry points, and a claim class that outlived the code)

**Theme —** `seed_doc` had two categories, a shipped skeleton and a file the adopter is using,
and the kit's own entry points are a third. Both halves of `#288` followed: `CLAUDE.md` rode
the `cp -r` quickstart into every adopter with nothing rendering, removing or reporting it, so
their Claude sessions loaded *the kit's* contract; and `AGENTS.md` was reached by file
**absence**, so the kit could not ship one and a Codex session working in the kit had no entry
point at all. `#274`'s class, on the two files whose whole job is to be read in the reading
repo.

- **`#288` — the third category** (`af004b9`, PR `#289`). `KIT_OWN_MARKER` on the kit's own
  root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`; an adopter's `init.sh` renders over both; a file carrying
  neither marker is still never touched. `AGENTS.md` holds the contract, `CLAUDE.md` imports
  it with `@AGENTS.md`, so one file states it and both runtimes load it in full.
- **`kit_doctor` now checks both entry points**, through a predicate that must agree with
  `_seedable`. Both sides pin `LC_ALL=C`: `[[:space:]]` is locale-dependent and they matched
  different characters under any real locale.
- **Filed:** `#290`, `#291`, `#292`. **Occurrences:** `#211`, `#120`, `#248`, `#209`, `#274`,
  and `#270`.

**Learned**

- **Each repair to the seed guard introduced the next defect**, all in one predicate. The two
  that destroyed a real file with no backup were both found by *running* `init.sh` against a
  hand-built fixture, never by reading it. `#211`'s thesis; the enumeration is on `#211`.
- **"What checks this new check" was answered wrong three times running** — a guard clause
  added to prevent silent overwrites was itself unpinned; the check added to catch an
  incomplete adoption was itself unchecked; the test added to pin a locale fix was itself
  locale-dependent and would have passed with the fix removed. Each found by mutation, none by
  reading. On `#211`.
- **The claims that survived review longest were the ones whose *form* looked rigorous** — a
  stated `grep` method whose scope was one file while the stale site sat in another, and a
  comment citing "the C locale" in a script that pinned no locale. A cited mechanism reads as
  verification and is not. Enumerated on `#248` as a sub-shape it did not name.
- **The code converged before the prose did, and the gap was most of the review.** The
  destructive findings stopped early; the rounds after them returned record and coverage
  findings almost exclusively. Evidence for `#120` over `#211` — on `#120`.
- **A lens wrote into the live checkout through the isolation route the doctrine prescribes.**
  `cp -R` of a *linked worktree* copies its `gitdir:` pointer, so the copy is not independent
  and `init.sh` in it rewrote the real repo's `.git/hooks/`. Invisible to the contract's own
  attestation, which reports on the handed tree. `#270`.
- **The local gate is weaker than CI.** An apostrophe in an `awk` comment closed the
  single-quoted program; `make test` reported a mass of unrelated pytest failures while CI's
  `sh -n init.sh` names the line. `#292`.

**Decided this session (operator)**

- **Codex as an equal-enough development environment, as soon as possible.** This is a
  standing goal and it lives on no ticket. It moved `#243` back off the backlog — but
  **sliced**: `adopt` + `upgrade` first, since the daily loop already works on Codex and the
  four missing workflows are lifecycle and maintenance.
- **Merged without a dual-lens pass at the merging head.** The last panel ran three commits
  earlier; no receipt was recorded, because one would have claimed coverage that does not
  exist and the engine refuses it once the head moves. The merge gate was the operator's
  decision plus green CI plus a bot review of the parent — stated on `#289` rather than left
  to be inferred from a missing receipt.

**Open, and owned by nothing yet**

- **`#290` and `#291` are one complaint** — a single boolean cannot carry what `kit_doctor`'s
  narrative check now sees, so a directory named `AGENTS.md` reports `in use` and the kit's
  own repo warns about its own entry points forever.
- **Carried forward:** `#243`, `#273`, `#105`, `#285`, `#283`, `#287`, `#286`, `#248`, `#264`,
  `#236`, `#231`, `#213`, `#167`, `#209`, `#211`, `#120`, `#216`, `#220`, `#203`, `#190`,
  `#187`, `#124`, `#169`, `#143`.

▶ Next: **`#273` direction 1** — one note on `safety-critical-changes.md` line 10 saying
`.claude/rules/` binds Claude only. It is the smallest step toward the Codex goal above and the
only one whose failure is *silent*: cs-toolkit follows that sentence today and its safety
doctrine reaches one of its two runtimes, so a Codex session touching a kill-path there is
unbound and nothing reports it. Then `#105` (a Codex adopter arriving via `/adopt` still gets
no entry point — this session fixed only the `init.sh` path). Read `#243`'s own scope note
before starting it: its line count is measured, stale, and growing.

______________________________________________________________________

## Earlier session — 2026-08-03 (the aim lever, and the bug the later rounds did not catch)

**Theme —** `#51`'s local half shipped, and the durable result is not the feature. What cost
more to learn than the code did is about *review*: an adopter upgrade found a defect that the
PR's later review rounds did not catch — and the cheapest explanation fails, because the round
pointed directly at the guards it lived in missed it too.

- **`#278` — `kit_commit` in the manifest, and `differs` split three ways** (`a042c82`).
  `STALE` / `LOCALLY EDITED` / `STALE and EDITED`, stated as fact rather than inferred from
  `kit.version`, which tracks the config schema and so never moved when kit files did.
- **`#280` — the fix that reopened the hole** (`d3faafb`). `#278`'s round-3 change replaced
  `.get("files") or {}` with an isinstance check and dropped the `None` handling; `None` is
  the sentinel for "no `--from-kit`", so verification silently switched off. Found by
  cs-toolkit's reviewer one commit after `#278` merged.
- **cs-toolkit upgraded** to the fixed kit, which was the first real use of `--record-install`
  and is where `#283` was found.

**Learned**

- **The design premise was wrong, and only measuring the adopter showed it.** `#51`'s comment
  said the local column "is already computed today". It is computed; the baseline it computes
  against was never written by any install path, so it had drifted nineteen days from the
  files beside it. Shipping the field alone would have relocated the false accusation rather
  than removing it.
- **Carry-forward can subtract attention — but it is not the whole story here.** No total is
  given, because every total I gave this was wrong and the enumeration is what holds. From the
  archived launch briefs: the bug entered in the fix for **round 3** (`accf8fa`), which round 4
  then reviewed; **round 4's brief aimed at those guards** ("whether each actually guards what
  it claims") and missed it;
  **rounds 5 and 6 named "the three isinstance degrade sites" as already covered**; **round 7
  reviewed a prose-only delta under a blanket "everything else is already covered"**. So a
  wrong coverage claim removed most of the chances and something else removed the one that was
  aimed. Recorded on `#211`, which the `#209` decision below recommends: a carry-forward
  asserting coverage should have to name the test or mutation that establishes it.

  **The briefs those figures come from are session scratch, not committed**, so a later reader
  cannot re-derive this from the repo. `#280`'s merged body and commit message state it
  differently again; treat this bullet as the account of record and that one as superseded.
- **Rounds 2 and 4 on `#278` returned disjoint lens sets**; the first convergence came at
  round 5. Direct evidence on the question `#209` turns on — recorded on `#278` itself, not on
  `#209`, which a review lens checked and found bare.
- **The configured bot reviewed a minority of heads while its check went green on all of
  them.** Its check surface carries no signal about whether a review happened — occurrence and
  the per-head table on `#45`.
- **A guard resting on an incidental property is not a guard.** `#278`'s first
  release-manifest check needed a `required_by` edge to fire, which is an accident of the
  current import graph. A lens called it fragile; cs-toolkit's real manifest then turned out
  to have none, so the original guard would have missed the live case.

**Decided this session (operator)**

- **`#209` — no proportionality valve.** None of directions 1–4 adopted, each refuted by a
  counter-example from a different PR; the issue body's recommendation of direction 1 is
  struck so a reader of the body cannot act on it. Next moves are `#211` then `#120`, both
  aimed at the finding *population* rather than the pass size.
- **Kit findings surfaced in an adopter route upstream, not into the adopter's PR.** A local
  edit to a kit-owned file reports `LOCALLY EDITED` on every later upgrade, which is the
  signal the baseline exists to give.

**Filed this session:** `#279`, `#281`, `#282`, `#283`; occurrences on `#45`, `#211`, `#270`.

**Open, and owned by nothing yet**

- **`#243` is still the precondition** for the `triage-friction-log` and
  `post-merge-systemize` conversions — the two that remain of the adapter work.
- **cs-toolkit's friction inbox is over budget with un-graduated dated sections.** Needs
  tracker writes plus operator approval, so it is `triage-friction-log`'s job and not a
  wrap-up's.
- **Carried forward:** `#248`, `#264`, `#236`, `#231`, `#213`, `#167`, `#120`, `#216`, `#220`,
  `#203`, `#190`, `#187`, `#124`, `#169`, `#143`.

▶ Next: **`#283`** — one paragraph in `/upgrade` Step 4 saying a copied release manifest must
be removed before `--record-install`, and that the mode exits 1 on a partial record. It is the
smallest of the four filed today, it is on the path every pre-`#51` adopter takes on their
next upgrade, and the fix is prose in a file that is already `/upgrade`-refreshed. `#281` is
the next-largest and is a real guard defect, but it needs a test over the near-miss keys
rather than a wording change.

## Earlier session — 2026-08-03 (three conversions, and a defect class that only exists in shipped docs)

**Theme —** `/session-start` was already converted; this session did the rest. `/parallel` and
`/wrap-up` now point at shared workflows, `/wrap-up` on **both** runtimes. The durable result is
not the conversions: it is that every conversion produced a defect where prose was **correct in
the repo that wrote it and false in the repo that reads it** — and that installing kit docs into
a repo with a fresh reviewer is the cheapest oracle found so far for finding them.

- **cs-toolkit `#1830` — install the shared workflows** (`bfcb4104`). Nine docs; `docs/agentic-dev-kit/`
  had held one. Sessions there had no panel doctrine when the bot went down. Its
  `session-start.md` was **content**-stale, not byte-stale as the previous handoff recorded —
  two commits behind, so the repo where the silent tracker truncation was hit was running the
  session-start without the fix for it.
- **kit `#268` — two rules recovered from the `/parallel` fork** (`8e57562`), and **cs-toolkit
  `#1831`** (`2ee66143`) converting it, 200 lines to 64.
- **kit `#272` — the validation step** (`c7eb7ea`), and **cs-toolkit `#1832`** converting
  `/wrap-up` on both runtimes, 197 lines to 62, renaming the Codex slug.
- **kit `#276` and cs-toolkit `#1833`** — the validation step demonstrated its own gap in the
  commit that introduced it, and the repair. See below.
- **Filed:** `#269`, `#270`, `#271`, `#273`, `#274` (the defect class above), plus an occurrence
  and a correction on `#61` and the fourth measurement on `#209`.

**Learned**

- **The defect class.** Five instances: the hook-install claim (true of cs-toolkit's `make`
  target, false of `init.sh`); the advice that followed from it; "no record of it **in this
  repo**", which inverts in an adopter because there *this repo* is the one holding the record;
  a `docs/plan/handoff/` path that never existed; and an archiver substitution that renamed the
  script but not its `--target-lines` flag. Each was written correctly and read wrongly. `#248`
  did not describe this and nothing else did either; filed as `#274`.
- **Installing kit docs into an adopter is a review oracle.** CodeRabbit found 12 findings on
  `#1830` against files it had reviewed long ago upstream — including a hardcoded prefix in a
  file that documents three ways that prefix can differ.
- **The `/wrap-up` fork inverted the pattern.** The other conversions found kit bugs the fork
  was hiding; this fork was running a remedy the kit lacked, and had open as `#119`. Its
  validation step had no upstream equivalent — seven distinctive phrases, zero hits.
- **The panel found a false claim by executing it**, in a paragraph written while citing `#248`
  for that exact failure. Verifying the cheap sub-claims is not verifying the claim.
- **Seeing an untracked file is not a control; staging by name is.** The validation step added
  in `#272` was defeated on its first live use, in the same commit: `git add -A` swept 228 lines
  of an adopter's uncommitted design note into a wrap-up PR, through review and merge. The
  pre-commit check **did** list the file. It was read for intent — "pre-existing, not mine" —
  rather than as a staging hazard, which is why "surface untracked files" would not have helped
  and is the fix that was **not** shipped. `#276` bans wildcard adds in the workflow instead;
  cs-toolkit `#1833` reverted the sweep, content verified byte-identical three ways.
- **The panel's own contract has a write channel it forbids.** Two live incidents: a scratch
  clone whose `origin` pointed at the handed tree took a pushed ref, and a lens deleted this
  repo's installed `pre-push` after inferring from an untracked path that it had created it.
  Both invisible to `git status --short`, which the contract names as its attestation. `#270`.
- **`paths.engines` carries two meanings** and cannot be right in an adopter with divergent
  originals. The obvious fix is foreclosed: relocating kit engines puts them under a formatter
  that rewrites them. Attempted and reverted. `#269`.
- **The kit tells adopters to bind doctrine through `.claude/rules/`**, listed first among three
  "equivalent" options, and that one binds a single runtime. cs-toolkit has 427 lines behind it,
  including its 66-line safety doctrine, reaching one of its two runtimes. `#273`.

**Decided this session (operator)**

- **Kit-owned docs are exempt from an adopter's formatters.** cs-toolkit's hook would have
  rewritten 8 of 9 installed docs, making every one read as a local edit permanently, with no
  adopter-side way to re-stamp the baseline. The exemption was verified in both directions and
  has since held twice while the same commits reformatted adapter files beside them.
- **`#209` is a decision to take, not a build to schedule** — and after the conversions, which
  is what happened. The build edits the doctrine it reforms, which `#213` measured at five
  rounds.
- **Two kit PRs merged on operator sign-off without a third panel**, both after their bot went
  rate-limited mid-PR. Recorded on each PR rather than left to be inferred from a missing
  receipt.

**Open, and owned by nothing yet**

- **cs-toolkit's own wrap-up is in flight**, run through the newly converted `/wrap-up` so the
  conversion gets an end-to-end exercise rather than only a review. Two things it cannot do:
  its friction inbox is over budget with four un-graduated dated sections, and graduating them
  needs tracker writes plus operator approval (`triage-friction-log`, a separate pass); and its
  `chore/update-plan-<date>` convention already collided with an earlier PR the same day, which
  is `#256` reproduced a third time.
- **Carried forward:** `#243` (still the precondition for the `triage-friction-log` and
  `post-merge-systemize` conversions — those two are what remain of the adapter work), `#209`,
  `#248`, `#264`, `#236`, `#231`, `#213`, `#167`, `#120`, `#216`, `#220`, `#203`, `#190`, `#187`,
  `#124`, `#169`, `#143`, `#93` (its content-recovery half is now discharged; its compatibility
  half was retired by operator decision).

▶ Next: **take the `#209` decision.** It is the operator's, it is cheap, and its input will not
get better — four measurements now, and this session added the one that bears on the direction
the issue currently recommends. Direction 1 would have reduced round 2 of `#268` to a single
lens, and that round's two lenses returned **disjoint** finding sets, so whichever ran alone
would have missed the other's entire set including the MEDIUM. Read the two comments on `#209`
before proposing anything: `#120`, `#211` and `#209` share one evidence body and the issue says
to weigh them together, which now covers five asks. Start from "none of directions 1–4 is
ready" rather than from picking one.

______________________________________________________________________

## Earlier session — 2026-08-03 (the tracker gather, and a failure mode `#248` had not named)

**Theme —** The shipped rule never changed after round one. Across **every** review round on
`#260` and `#263`, each finding was in a claim written *about* the fix — and the dominant shape
was not a drifted restatement but an inference presented as an observation, which `#248` does
not currently describe. Both loops ended by **deleting** the claim that kept breaking rather
than repairing it again.

- **`#260` — `session-start`'s tracker gather gets a row limit** (`601a225`). Its PR bullet was
  hardened in `e49ddf3`; the tracker bullet three lines below carried nothing, because
  "field-limited" governs *which fields*, never *how many rows*. Field selection and the row
  limit are separate controls, and the returned count is now suspect against **two** ceilings —
  yours and the backend's.
- **`#262` — the same gather in `parallel plan`** (`fd9506f`), by pointer rather than copy. A
  truncation there does not shorten a briefing, it narrows the input to a set of isolated lanes,
  and nothing downstream recovers the tickets past the cut.
- **`#263` — prefer the backend's own has-more signal** (`56b42bf`). Row-count arithmetic is the
  fallback, not the method. Evidence the previous PR could not have had: Linear at its schema
  maximum answered `hasNextPage: true` — `#260`'s ceiling-equals-count case, reported outright
  instead of inferred.
- **`#258` — the handoff stops restating derived state** (`7546bdd`). The rule **replaced**
  `wrap-up.md`'s "The invariant, not the figure" rather than joining it: that bullet is what
  permitted the defect, since the stale line followed it exactly. This block is the rule's first
  use.
- **Filed:** `#264` (Jira's `nextPageToken` is an input, `endCursor` the output; the doc presents
  them as symmetric with Linear's `cursor`), `#261` (filed and closed here), and **`CUS-1119`**
  on cs-toolkit's own tracker. Occurrences on `#42`, `#44` (where a later comment retracts a fix
  an earlier one proposed), `#143`, `#179`, `#248`.

**Learned**

- **The rule was never the defect.** Every finding was in the surrounding evidence — an untested
  mechanism, a measurement that broke its own stated method, a citation to the wrong issue. What
  ended both loops was removal: the byte-comparison row that drew defects in consecutive rounds
  was cut rather than repaired again.
- **`#248` may be named too narrowly.** Its framing is a restated fact drifting from its owner.
  The dominant failure here was an **inference presented as an observation** — "ask for 500 and
  you get 100" when both cited clients reject; "one field set across all three" when the template
  rendered four of six. A restatement has a source to diff against; an untested assertion has
  none, which is why nothing catches it. Both instances were found by a lens that **called the
  tool** rather than read its schema. Enumerated on `#248`.
- **The operator asking "is that actually true?" was the cheapest intervention available**, and
  it fired on claims inherited from this repo's own archive — including "no MCP server is
  configured in this checkout", which was false and was the premise of a whole paragraph.
- **A rate-limited bot's stub carries the same commit-range marker as a real review.** On one PR
  that marker sat beside a genuine clean review; on the next, beside "we couldn't start this
  review". Zero review objects in both. The discriminator is the actionable-comments marker —
  which `review.noise_markers` deliberately discards. `#44`.

**Decided this session (operator)**

- **Both `wrap-up` runtimes harmonize in one pass.** Nothing relies on cs-toolkit's Codex
  `session-wrap-up` skill, so `#93`'s *compatibility* half is retired and the slug becomes a plain
  rename. Its *content-recovery* half stands: those forked lines may hold knowledge the shared doc
  lacks, so map before deleting.
- **The "Filed this session" list stays.** An event is not a tally — the enumeration is
  recoverable only by a dated tracker query; a count beside it is what recounts keep finding
  wrong. Written into `wrap-up.md`'s rule.

**cs-toolkit pre-flight — this changes the next step**

Established by comparing `kit-manifest.json` against the live checkout, not assumed:

- **`parallel.md` is not installed there**, so the standing "convert the `/parallel` adapter"
  had no target to point at. Most of the manifest is likewise absent, including
  `fallback-review-panel.md` and `safety-critical-changes.md` — sessions there have no panel
  doctrine when a bot goes down.
- **Its `session-start.md` is content-identical to kit `6bf4443` but byte-different** — a
  markdown formatter reflowed tables and re-wrapped paragraphs. `kit_doctor` compares bytes, so
  a formatter in an adopter makes kit-owned docs read as drifted permanently. Bears on `#51`.
- **`CUS-1119`** — its `list_dev_backlog.py` caps at 40, does not page, and applies the cap
  *before* filtering, against a Linear project whose size is on that ticket. The kit fix does not
  reach it.

**Open, and owned by nothing yet**

- **Carried forward:** `#243` (still the precondition for the `triage-friction-log` /
  `post-merge-systemize` conversions, not for `/parallel`), `#256`, `#248`, `#264`, `#236`,
  `#231`, `#213`, `#167`, `#209`, `#120`, `#216`, `#220`, `#203`, `#190`, `#187`, `#124`, `#169`,
  `#93`, `#143`.

▶ Next: **cs-toolkit — install the shared workflows first, then convert `/parallel` and
`/wrap-up` together.** Install at current `main`, not at whatever the repo last saw. Then
`/parallel` (a ~200-line fork with its shared doc now present) and `/wrap-up` on **both**
runtimes in one pass — `.claude/commands/wrap-up.md` and `.agents/skills/session-wrap-up/`,
renaming that slug to `wrap-up`. Use the method `in-parallel-oy/cs-toolkit#1826` proved: map
every section before deleting any, and contribute anything generic upstream first. Every
conversion so far has found a kit bug the fork was hiding.
